Hello! I am a second-year research graduate student from [school of economics](https://www.econ.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/). I received my bachelor's degree of economics from Shandong University in 2021. 

My research interest focuses on interdisciplinary researches based on economics using artificial intelligence, public economics, energy economics, environmental economics, and health economics. To support my research, I have enrolled in various courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) such as Python for Everybody Specialization(by Charles Russell Severance), IBM Generative AI Engineering Professional Certificate(by IBM), and Machine Learning(by Andrew Ng), etc. I am enthusiastically curious about new things both in real world and in academic field, and are strongly motivated to learn from them. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yugang Tang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/tangyugang/zh_CN/index.htm).

You can find my CV here: [Mingzhong Wang's CV](../assets/Mingzhong Wang CV.pdf).
